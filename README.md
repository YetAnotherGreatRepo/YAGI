# YAGM (Yet Another Great Motivator)
A tool to remind me of all the great feedback I received on Hacker News regarding my issues with productivity

Based on my article ["There are too many shiny objects and it is killing me"](https://yetanothergreatidea.wordpress.com/2015/02/18/there-are-too-many-shiny-objects-and-it-is-killing-me/)

### How does an article become a repository?
I was really blown away by the comments on my article on Hacker News. Not only did I feel like I'm not struggling alone with issues like zero productivity, a constant lack of discipline and various mysterious, yet unidentifiable, body odors caused by prolonged man-caving -- I also read some pretty awesome ideas and suggestions which could be instrumental in my efforts to turn the tide.

The first thing I did was extracting snippets of advice from the comments and catalog them into a XML file. New schoolers will raise an eyebrow, murmuring _"didn't the development community settle on JSON a while ago?"_ and you would be partially right. Ok, you're right. I have no idea why I chose XML. However, I'm trying really hard to stay focused and write 'ugly' (but functioning) code first, so I will not be changing the XML right now. 

I couldn't resist TDD though. It pleasures me. Mentally, not physically. I just get off on watching the code grow organically. This is the only way for me, because without TDD I feel lost. I would be still setting up my project in n-tier layers, adding folders named 'Model', 'Service' and God knows what else before writing a single line of actual code.

### The goal
I'm taking all those gems and create a little desktop application that will remind me periodically of the things I need to change in my own character. 

The app will be my digital fortune cookie, keeping me on the path of enlightenment, making me follow the yellow brick road, guide me in my quest to the dark cracks of Mordor (read: my shower) so I can become the man I once aspired to be, but never was, because somebody else became him and I'm me.

And when procrastination, or however you want to call the mental blockage in my brain, tries to creep back into my workplace, then I will quote the great Jack Nicholson from the movie [The Shining (1980)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081505/). 

(Just substitute _'Wendy'_ for _'Procrastination'_.)

> Wendy, let me explain something to you. Whenever you come in here and interrupt me, you're breaking my concentration. You're distracting me. And it will then take me time to get back to where I was. Understand?...I'm gonna make a new rule. Whenever I'm in here, and you hear me typing, whether you don't hear me typing, whatever the f--k you hear me doing in here, when I'm in here, that means that I am working. That means don't come in. Now do you think you can handle that?...Why don't you start right now and get the f--k out of here?

### Wireframes and Mocks

It will be a small program and it will look like this.

What I have learned from all the comments is that I need to get a MVP released as soon as I can, so in the first release I will not include any theming functionality.

### Exercise
This thing is really an exercise. Start something and - more importantly - finish it. No bullshit, no Wikipedia research into stuff I will never encounter in my life, no excuses.
